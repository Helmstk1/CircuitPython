### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on the knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.




## How To Fix the LCD power issue with Metro M4 boards.

### Description & Code

* **The symptoms:**  LCD acting weird OR trouble with usb connection / serial monitor / uploading / etc.
* **The problem :** The LCDs occasionally draw too much power when we turn on the boards, and that makes parts of its serial communications crash.
* **The Solution:** Add this code, and wire a switch up, like the wiring diagram below:



```python
import board
import time
import digitalio
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# turn on lcd power switch pin
lcdPower = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D8)
lcdPower.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
lcdPower.pull = digitalio.Pull.DOWN

# Keep the I2C protocol from running until the LCD has been turned on
# You need to flip the switch on the breadboard to do this.
while lcdPower.value is False:
    print("still sleeping")
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Time to start up the LCD!
time.sleep(1)
print(lcdPower.value)
print("running")

i2c = board.I2C()
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)


# Loop forever.
while True:
