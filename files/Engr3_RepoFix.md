So I messed up the readme that you copied, it had a section from last year's repo, that you no longer need.  

To fix this, you are going to do a couple of steps:
* Click **raw** on the top right of this file, so you can see the full coded text.
* Scroll to the bottom, and copy everything below the line.
* Now go to YOUR repository, and edit your readme
* Highlight the text shown here, and then paste it over with the text I've provided at the bottom of this page.

Copy everything from below this line:
